# Serverless App For Country Data

I created this basic REST API with Typescript on AWS Lambda using Serverless framework. Serverless framework provides useful boiler plates and It can invoke lambdas locally without Docker installation. I used Axios for external API usage, mocha/chai for unit testing.
